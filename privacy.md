### What information does EtchDroid collect?

Nothing. EtchDroid does not collect any information about you or your device.

That's it. No analytics, no telemetry, no tracking, no ads.

### Crash reports

Although EtchDroid does not collect any crash reports, if you use the Google
Play services and you've opted into sharing usage and diagnostics information
with Google, then Google Play services will collect crash reports on behalf of
EtchDroid and I will be able to see them in an anonymized form in the Google
Play Console.
